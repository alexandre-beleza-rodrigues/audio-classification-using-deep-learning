# Audio-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
 
 # Project Overview 
* Created an artificial neural network witch classifies sounds, using 10 categories of sound, with an ccuracy of 85%.
* For this project I used a dataset wich you can find [here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound8k.html).
* I started with some Exploratory Data Analysis and then scaled and standerdized the data.
* After that I build a neural network and trained the model.
